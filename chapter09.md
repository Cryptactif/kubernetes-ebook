# Chapter 9: Verify cluster status

In this chapter we verify that various components of the cluster are setup correctly, and are working as expected.

* short chapter.
* Just verification of components.
* What to expect in logs, etc.


Run pods, deployments, etc.

Tip: Verify pod accessibility using nodeport , because we have still not setup load balancer yet.
